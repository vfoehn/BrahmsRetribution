# BrahmsRetribution
A small PC game with Johannes Brahms as the protagonist

Brahms' Retribution is a small RPG in which you control the Johannes Brahms who is on a mission to find the score of his third symphony. On his way to recover the sore he has to explore the world and overcome his enemies.

I created Brahms' Retribution to familiarize myself with the Framework LibGDX. Currently, it is only possible to play it on PC. However, since it was developed in Android Studio it can easily be extended to be played on Android.

To launch the game in Android Studio you can follow these instructions:
1. Open BrahmsRetribution in Android Studio
2. Select the *Gradle* tab on the very right hand side
3. Select *:desktop* dropdown
4. Press *Execute Gradle Task* above
5. Enter "dist" in the command line

An executable jar file of the game should now be located in /desktop/build/libs.

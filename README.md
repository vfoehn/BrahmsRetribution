# BrahmsRetribution

Brahms' Retribution is a small RPG in which you control the Johannes Brahms who is on a mission to find the score of his third symphony. On his way to recover the score he has to explore the world and overcome his enemies.\
The game takes place in an interactive 2D world. Brahms can open chests to find items, such as guns. The guns can then be used to kill enemies while they are trying to kill Brahms. Once the final boss is defeated, a hidden door leading to the score of Brahms' third symphony opens up.

I created Brahms' Retribution to familiarize myself with the Framework LibGDX. Currently, it is only possible to play it on PC. However, since it was developed in Android Studio it can easily be extended to be played on Android.

To launch the game in Android Studio you can follow these instructions:
1. Open BrahmsRetribution in Android Studio
2. Select the *Gradle* tab on the very right hand side
3. Select *:desktop* button dropdown
4. Press *Execute Gradle Task* above
5. Enter "dist" in the command line

An executable jar file of the game should now be located in /desktop/build/libs.
